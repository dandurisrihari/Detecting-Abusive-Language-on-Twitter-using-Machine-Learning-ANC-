2.In case if it asks for any missing package update the upackage using !pip install <package name>
3. All the dirctory for input data and glove.txt is given with respect to the New_project root directory. It will give error if the directory address is altereted.
4.The collab will mount the directory and It has to be given permission to to access the directory.
Run the Hate_CNN.ipynb to run the CNN model.
Run the Hate_LSTM.ipynb to run the LSTM model.
Run the Naive_Bayes.ipynb to run the Naive_bayes model.
